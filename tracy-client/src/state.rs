/// Enabling `Tracy` when it is already enabled, or Disabling when it is already disabled will
/// cause applications to crash. I personally think it would be better if this was a sort-of
/// reference counted kind-of thing so you could enable as many times as you wish and disable
/// just as many times without any reprecursions. At the very least this could significantly
/// help tests.
///
/// We can also try to implement something like this ourselves. To do this we'd want to track 4
/// states that construct a following finite state machine:
///
/// ```text
///     0 = disabled  -> 1 = enabling
///         ^                v
///     3 = disabling <- 2 = enabled
/// ```
///
/// And also include a reference count somewhere in there. Something we can throw in a static
/// would be ideal.
///
/// Alas, Tracy's extensive use of thread-local storage presents us with another problem – we must
/// start up and shut down the client within the same thread. A most straightforward soution for
/// that would be to run a separate thread that would be dedicated entirely to just starting up and
/// shutting down the profiler.
///
/// All that seems like a major pain to implement, and so we’ll punt on disabling entirely until
/// somebody comes with a good use-case warranting that sort of complexity.
