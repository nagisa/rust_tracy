///
/// ```
/// use tracing_subscriber::fmt::format::DefaultFields;
///
/// struct TracyLayerConfig {
///     fmt: DefaultFields,
/// }
/// impl tracing_tracy::Config for TracyLayerConfig {
///     type Formatter = DefaultFields;
///     fn formatter(&self) -> &Self::Formatter {
///         &self.fmt
///     }
///     // The boilerplate ends here
///
///     /// Collect 32 frames in stack traces.
///     fn stack_depth(&self, _: &tracing::Metadata) -> u16 {
///         32
///     }
///
///     /// Do not format fields into zone names.
///     fn format_fields_in_zone_name(&self) -> bool {
///         false
///     }
///
///     // etc.

    /// Another example a limitation in `Tracy` where the message length or zone name cannot exceed
    /// a certain (low) limit of bytes.
    ///
    /// Although `tracing_tracy` does it best to paper over these sorts of differences, it canâ€™t
    /// always make them invisible. In certain cases detecting these sorts of issues is
    /// straightforward, and it is when `tracing_tracy` will invoke this method to enable users to
